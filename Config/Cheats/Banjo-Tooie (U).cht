Cheat31="Beta Bottles Revenge Mode",8012B3F2 0001,800810C1 0002
Cheat31_N=Bottles Revenge is a Beta mode from Banjo Tooie that the RWP team recently uncovered after an extraordinary amount of effort. Bottles the Spirit transforms into Bottles the Devil and posses enemies nearby and allows a second player hooked up to Pad 2 to play as that Posses character to try to foil Banjos Plans. As player one goes about its business, player two uses every enemy nearby to try to nab Banjo and take away some life. This mode is incredible, and you can control almost every enemy in the game: slot machines, flying creatures, uggers, zubbas...and this is just the beginning. (Congrats Rare Witch Project)
